# Project-Hangman
Hangman game in three different programming languages (C#, JavaScript, Python), each as a separate implementation.
- About the game:
  - This is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The game can be played in two modes: a single-player mode where the computer selects a word from a predefined list, and a two-player mode where one player inputs a word for the other player to guess.

  - Features:
      - Single-Player Mode: The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list for the player to guess.
      - Two-Player Mode: One player inputs a word that the second player must guess.
      - Interactive Gameplay: Players can input their guesses and receive immediate feedback.
      - (TENTATIVE) Visual Representation: The game includes a classic hangman drawing that updates with each incorrect guess.
      - Word Display: The current state of the word is displayed with unguessed letters represented by underscores.
