# Hangman Game
This project presents Hangman, the classic word-guessing game, implemented in three different programming languages: C#, JavaScript, and Python. Each language has its own standalone version of the game, offering a diverse coding perspective on how to build a similar functionality across platforms.

# About the Game
The Hangman game challenges players to guess a hidden word, letter by letter, before running out of attempts. If a player suggests an incorrect letter, part of a hangman figure is drawn, progressing toward a complete figure with each wrong guess. The game offers two play modes:
  -  Single-Player Mode: The computer selects a word randomly from a predefined list, and the player tries to guess it.
  -  Two-Player Mode: One player inputs a word, which the other player attempts to guess.
Whether playing alone or with a friend, Hangman provides a simple yet engaging experience, perfect for practicing problem-solving skills.

# Features
  -  Single-Player Mode: In this mode, the game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, making each game session unique and challenging.
  -  Two-Player Mode: This mode allows for a more interactive experience between two players, where one player manually enters a word for the other player to guess.
  -  Interactive Gameplay: Players enter guesses one letter at a time, receiving instant feedback on their progress. Each correct letter is revealed, while incorrect guesses bring the hangman closer to completion.
  -  Visual Representation (Optional): The game includes an optional hangman drawing that updates with each incorrect guess, visually displaying the player's remaining chances.
  -  Word Display: The current state of the word is shown with underscores for unguessed letters, allowing players to easily track their progress.

# Technologies Used
This project demonstrates cross-language implementation and showcases different approaches to programming logic:
  -  C#: Handles game state and user input with an object-oriented approach.
  -  JavaScript: Creates responsive, interactive browser features.
  -  Python: Used for quick, easy-to-understand prototyping.

Each version includes a unique approach to the same game mechanics, making it an excellent resource for comparing programming techniques and design decisions across languages.
